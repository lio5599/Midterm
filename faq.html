        <h2 style = font-size:24pt>Is there a takeout or delivery service?</h2>
      <p style = font-size:18pt>
        As of right now, all dining must take place in the restaurant, but we are hoping to implement a delivery service that
        will allow our delicious food to arrive right at your door step. For now, bring the family in and enjoy a delicious meal
        in house!
       </p>

       <h2 style = font-size:24pt>Are there any COVID-19 restrictions in restaurant?</h2>
      <p style = font-size:18pt>
        With the decline in COVID-19 cases, we do not have any restrictions. If you and your family would like to
        take precaution, you can ask for a table isolated from other customers and we will gladly fulfill your request!
       </p>

       <h2 style = font-size:24pt>What payment methods do you accept?</h2>
      <p style = font-size:18pt>
        We accept all types of payments! Credit card, cash, and check are our most common but we will accept any kind!
       </p>

       <h2 style = font-size:24pt>Can I make a reservation? How far in advanced do I need to make a reservation?</h2>
      <p style = font-size:18pt>
        We do allow reservations! By policy, we require that you make a reservation at least one day in advance for when you stay.
        For example, if you want to make a reservation for 6:00 PM on Saturday, you must make the reservation by 6:00 PM by Friday.
       </p>

       <h2 style = font-size:24pt>Do you host private events or parties?</h2>
      <p style = font-size:18pt>
        Yes! Whether it is a birthday party, family gathering, or company meeting, we can arrange a private event that 
        gives you and your guests a wonderful time!
